# Safety-Equipment-Detection-
A computer vision-based system was developed to detect wearable safety equipment like helmets, vests, and gloves in real-time. Deep learning models were trained on annotated datasets, and detection was performed using YOLOv8. The system was designed to enhance workplace safety by automating PPE monitoring and reducing manual supervision.
